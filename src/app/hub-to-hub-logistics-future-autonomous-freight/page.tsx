          <h1>Hub-to-Hub Logistics: The Future of Autonomous Freight</h1>
          
          <p>
            Hub-to-hub logistics represents the most viable path to autonomous freight deployment, 
            offering a controlled environment that maximizes safety while delivering significant 
            operational benefits. This operational model is set to transform the $2.5 trillion 
            freight industry and create massive opportunities for early adopters.
          </p>

          <h2>What is Hub-to-Hub Logistics?</h2>
          
          <p>
            Hub-to-hub logistics involves autonomous trucks operating between designated freight 
            hubs, typically located on highways or in industrial areas. This model eliminates 
            the complexity of urban driving while maintaining the efficiency gains of autonomous 
            technology.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Characteristics:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Controlled Routes:</strong> Pre-mapped highways between major freight hubs</li>
